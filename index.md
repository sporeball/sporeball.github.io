### about

we are a [plural system of 7 headmates](pages/system_information), making weird things slowly.\
*it's nice to meet you.*

we currently work at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com){:target="_blank"} as part of the engineering team.

you can see a full list of our projects [here](pages/works).

### where to find us

currently, we are mainly active on [GitHub](https://github.com/sporeball){:target="_blank"}.\
in the past, we were active on [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@sporeball){:target="_blank"} and regularly contributed to [Hack Club's scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/sporeball){:target="_blank"}.

we occasionally release electronic music via [Bandcamp](https://sporeball.bandcamp.com){:target="_blank"}, and you can support us by listening to it.\
all of [these lovely people](pages/thanks) have, at one time or another, supported us via Bandcamp or (formerly) Patreon.
