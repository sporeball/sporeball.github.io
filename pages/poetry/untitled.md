sometimes it feels like we haven't eaten\
since the last time you gave us shit,\
haven't had anything to drink\
since the last time you spit in our face.\
just like the hormones in our body,\
you are just another thing that we need to replace.

your words coming out\
again and again and again and again\
like a broken record,\
stinging and burning\
like a broken ankle,\
giving us a broken heart.\
you will never know what it's like to be in our shoes, in our own head.\
you're so ignorant of our struggles, we don't even know where to start.

you may get our name and pronouns right most times, but you get so many other things wrong.\
you're a constant source of trauma and you sing it out like it's your favorite song.\
you said we dress too suggestively, that earrings does not equal girl.\
you said you don't support us destroying our body.\
you're just like everybody else in the world.

do you realize what you're saying?\
do you realize how you sound?\
do you realize that you've never been happy for us\
for all the joys we've found?\
do you realize that you make things worse\
with every word you say?\
you reinforce your echo chamber\
with every passing day.

you may have lost your son, but you gained another daughter\
who's more than happy to be able to fill that role.\
but your heart's so frozen solid, so completely closed to change,\
that it still bears a boy-shaped hole.\
we wish we could explain to you and your supposed god\
that we're so much better off this way\
in words that you could understand -\
so much more ourselves.\
so if there is another life after this one,\
we're more than happy to spend it in hell.

you told us to our fucking face\
that the stories of those who detransition are being erased.\
well, doctor, i'm going to have you remove the "de",\
for transition - nay, being trans -\
means you're always in danger of being erased - nay, wiped off the face of the earth\
by people with views like yours.\
reduced to ashes by hateful words and actions\
practiced not by one or two, but tens of thousands or more.

it's been more than two years since we realized,\
every time they do call us girl or ma'am or miss, our power grows.\
so we changed our habits, our name, and we bought new clothes.\
we killed our libido, grew tits on our chest,\
and after all that work, you still think mother knows best.\
you think we'll back down, that we'll let all this go.\
but there's one more thing we need to make sure that you know -\
our name is Lux,\
and our pronoun is she.\
we're still fucking here, and we always will be.
