title: sonder.

---

the idea that you might never see somebody again,\
but you still had an effect on their life.\
an acknowledgment that you are not the main character\
in this fucked-up story.\
the realization\
that what you don't know about a person\
could fill ten thousand printed pages -\
sonder in its purest form.

a chance encounter\
with somebody who is, in some way, more famous than you are.\
a stark awareness of the many other people who are driving alongside you\
during your commute,\
but who are headed to completely different destinations.\
a full seven-odd billion bodies who you will never meet,\
but who are still changing the world outside your frame of view.\
these crazy moments, ideas, dreams, you see,\
are actually the norm.

i can't look at you out there in the crowd\
and know just what you did before coming here.\
every thought that's been thought, every word that's been said,\
it all adds up to something bigger than any one of us.\
each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own.
