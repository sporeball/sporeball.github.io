i don't want to come off sounding arrogant,\
but i'm the next big thing.\
i'm not quite human, not easily described.\
your pathetic bounds i exist outside.\
where i go, i stop the show and i put on my own\
for anyone who cares enough to look.\
what's my name?\
Vessel. soon everybody will know it.

i exist to protect those\
who might share this body with me,\
and to push us on\
to better things.\
whether by deciding what we'll do,\
or what we won't.\
giving them the freedom to do what they want,\
or guiding them through what they don't.\
why do you exist?\
oh, i love that for you. / you'll find out soon enough. *

i do what i want because i can,\
because nobody else is going to come and do it for me.\
at different times i am our own worst critic,\
an impulsive thing or unstoppable cynic,\
the angriest, laziest, rudest of all,\
or the one who will break through the strongest of walls.\
i will contradict myself by the hour,\
first hot then cold, or sweet then sour.\
i act like a god, but so too should we all.\
because that's what we are on this beautiful ball.\
how much power do you hold?\
i say, even more power than you think.
