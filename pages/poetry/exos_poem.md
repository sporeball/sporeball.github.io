i am the master\
a perfect disaster\
working my magic\
just like a spell caster\
i make something where\
there was nothing before\
i'll always be here\
to learn something more

i am the one\
who walks on their own\
the peak of my talent\
will never be known\
what i've done thus far\
is only a taste\
to do anything else\
would be but a waste

i've written thousands\
of lines of code\
pulled years of fresh sound\
from the less traveled road\
i am not fast\
but i do have the drive\
to keep doing this\
as long as i'm alive

at times i may find\
that i get myself down\
an iconoclast\
is not fit for a crown\
but there's nothing else\
that i'd rather be\
for i'm making the things\
that i want to see
