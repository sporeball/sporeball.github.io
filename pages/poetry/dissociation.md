3:30pm.\
i'm sitting at work.\
probably.\
i don't actually know for sure.\
in this moment, i don't know\
if what i am seeing\
is real.

it's as if the walls\
would let me phase straight through them,\
everybody else\
is a figment of my imagination,\
and the whole world\
and everything in it\
could fall away at any moment.

if i could tap my coworker on the shoulder,\
reach out and touch the items on the shelf,\
or get closer to all the things outside the room,\
then i could prove for myself\
that they're really there.

but i can't just go around touching everything.\
everybody just knows that the things are there.\
because of course they are.\
so why can't i convince myself\
that that's true?

even as i stand here,\
in this place i've been\
so many times before,\
i'm not even completely sure i can convince myself\
of you.
