hi!\
i love you, do you understand?\
no one compares - it's simple.\
you make me so happy.

your voice is like candy, and i want to hear it more.\
i miss it.\
i understand you're over there, but...\
it's hard.

i hope you are well, even though i am not there.\
don't stop doing amazing things.\
i love you.
