it really sunk in\
as we waited to get dippin' dots\
with part of a friend's polycule\
just how happy everybody was\
at pride.\
each attendee so happy to be\
themselves -\
and us among them.\
thousands of people\
united.

it figures, really.\
our college put on a drag show\
and Rhyme, who fronted to see it,\
never smiled so big.\
somehow, suddenly,\
she felt loved -\
felt like it might be okay to be anything\
she wanted to be.\
it's no surprise\
that this past Sunday\
did the same.

this is what they want to take away from us\
all over the country -\
all over the world.

"we're still fucking here,\
and we always will be"\
is a line we've spoken before\
in reference to ourselves.\
but here, if you're so inclined,\
we want you to apply it\
to yourself, too.\
because you know yourself,\
and nobody in the world\
can take that away from you.

when this month is over,\
keep being prideful.\
pride season,\
pride year,\
pride *life*.\
take the ethos\
of celebrations past\
and carry it with you constantly.\
the whole world\
will be better for it\
even if\
they don't want to believe it.
