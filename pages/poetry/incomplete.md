"how's your incomplete work coming along?"\
why do you care so much?\
as long as we get it done, right?\
oh, i see - we haven't.\
it's almost the end of June\
and that work from the fall\
that we still have a few more months to finish\
is still hanging over our head.\
and so, so are you.

"i can literally see you on your computer right now."\
so what?\
you don't seem to realize that what we're doing there\
is something that we actually *care* about.\
maybe if you could find a way\
to make our traumatized, attention-deficit brain\
give a shit?\
(constantly asking for an update doesn't count.)

"i don't want to have that job" (the one of bothering us.)\
then don't take it.\
keep your fucking mouth *shut*.\
we want to finish before the deadline\
just as much as you want us to.\
do you understand?\
i don't think you do.

i fear that we may sound like a broken record,\
talking on this topic yet again.\
but maybe *you* are the ones who need to change.\
i'm sorry that this doesn't make sense to you\
and that all you see\
is all the time we've "wasted" on the stage.\
we're finding more community than we ever have,\
so why should we stay\
in your cage?
