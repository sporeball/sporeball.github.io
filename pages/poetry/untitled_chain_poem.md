more than anything else, we make people think.\
think everything from "that was cool!" to "why are you still here?"\
here we stand, showing you the answer.\
answer to nobody, and you can stand here too.\
too many days they say we've spent with our cube and our code, our music and our prose.\
prose we're here to read again, because we choose to make it so.\
so many excursions and diversions that they cast aspersions, because this is not what we're supposed to do.\
do you want to let them decide how to define you?\
you know we don't.\
don't you see? what they think doesn't matter to us.\
us four, we get to decide what to do - no if, and, or but.\
but because we'll soon be back again, having done something more...\
more than anything else, we make people think.
