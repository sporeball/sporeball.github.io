our commute sometimes ends\
in a night walk\
through streets which take on a whole different character\
without the sun to light them\
streetlights are our sun now\
and they do not light the streets the same way

turn around\
to make sure nobody is following us\
but on this night there are no other souls to be found\
only the wind whistling\
through the trees\
and the cars moving\
across the asphalt\
their drivers unseen

we pass the apartments we wish we could live in\
wonder who is living there now\
we pass stores that we would not dare to go into\
at this hour\
maybe another time

we wonder what it would be like\
to do this with somebody else\
holding their hand\
enjoying this quiet night\
together

finally we reach our street\
and the sound of cars begins to fade\
we reach our door\
and use our key to open it\
we reach our room\
and our night walk\
is over
