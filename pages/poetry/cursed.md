we are cursed\
as if by an ancient caster's spell\
to feel like we ourselves are the fell,\
each living our own nightmare.

we are cursed\
as if we've read a haunted tome\
to never feel safe in this place we call home,\
this hellhole with no room to spare.

we are cursed\
as if hit by an eldritch charm\
to avoid what we must do, and thus do harm,\
by falling ever further away.

we are cursed\
as if affected by some unknown force\
to simply let things run their course,\
and let the chips fall where they may.

we are cursed\
as if from exposure to fleshbound book\
to have demons close in wherever we look,\
ridding the world of its shine.

we are cursed,\
all of us.\
the aim of the game is to see who survives\
their curse for the longest time.
