"thank you for being so consistent", Kevin said.\
that we are.\
we must have performed close to twenty times so far.\
for an hour or two, here we're safe in your hands,\
so we've factored you once again into our plans.

"are you sporeball tonight?" Julian asked.\
yes, we are.\
on that Friday night, after coming so far,\
we were recognized before playing our live electronic set.\
that's the kind of recognition we so rarely get.

"give it up for Lux", Tryn will say.\
because that's who we are.\
and when we come to this place under sun, moon, and star,\
she knows it's because we're genuinely so happy to be able to share what we do.\
so, Nirvana Soul, we have to say...\
thank you.
