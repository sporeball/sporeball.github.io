these 78\
black and white cards\
a safety net\
of love and communion.\
what happens here\
is between a soul and its maker.\
we form an authority\
with our shining union.

its answers ring strong.\
its advice rings clear.\
its resources are enough\
to take care of you for years.\
let us do a reading for you.\
you have nothing to fear.

somebody asked if they'd be cursed\
by coming into contact with this stuff the other day,\
and the deck called up the fool reversed\
to reply, "no, you won't - that's a silly thing to say."

somebody touched a few cards\
to wonder at their glowing faces,\
and the deck asked\
with the king of swords reversed\
to be purified -\
brought into less chaotic spaces.\
we cleansed it with a shuffle, a rhythmic four-way split\
and bought some salt\
for the next time it needs it.

somebody asked more or less the same important question\
two separate times -\
once asking for one card, once a spread of three -\
and the single card, the ten of swords, appeared as part of the spread, as well,\
confirming for them\
what they asked of me.

if you think this is stupid,\
that a deck of cards couldn't possibly be so advanced,\
can you explain how it's helped all it's encountered\
better than a simple game of chance?\
can you explain these little stories i've just told\
that fit their respective situations so well?\
there's something here.\
as time goes on,\
there are so many more stories we'll be able to tell.

here we dream, receive insights, go into trance.\
come to us.\
give tarot a chance.
