somebody told us their body count.\
the number was higher than the number of people we think of as friends\
by a factor of five, or maybe ten.\
it's amazing, isn't it?\
that one can trust so many people, so much\
when we have trouble with eye contact -\
we hardly say a word.

conditioned over time to understand that our word should not be spoken -\
our vow of silence should not be broken.\
nobody told us that directly, but in nineteen years we've picked up on a false fact -\
we should be seen, and not heard.

maybe that's why, many weeks,\
we keep coming back to this place,\
to perform for you all, face to face.\
because we live for this.\
because every time we feel strong enough to break that spell,\
then maybe it means that we're among friends -\
that we're doing something right.

if you're feeling like that, like you need a friend,\
we'd love to be yours!\
a party of one is the first step to scores.\
and if not, that's okay too.\
enjoy yourself.\
we hope you have a fantastic night.
