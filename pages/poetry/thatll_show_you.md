they say about our work: "it's nothing i haven't seen before."\
they say, "nobody needs that. here's the door"\
or, "all of this has been done to death"\
a plethora of attempts all ignored by scores\
but there's one more thing they forgot -\
my god, we've been through hell\
we've saved ourselves\
from feeling like nothing more than empty shells\
as we work to unlearn our shame, and our guilt\
we decide what kind of life we get to say that we've built\
so if we have the strength to get out\
in front of a crowd, our outfits loud,\
who are you\
to tell us what we are and aren't allowed to do?\
if we can cause you to get lost\
in our worlds, our microcosms\
for even sixty precious seconds -\
well,\
that'll show you.
