i want to be able to go to sleep\
without worrying about the tomorrow i'm going to forget.\
i want to be able to go to school\
without thinking about things that haven't even happened yet.\
i want to be able to go to the stage\
without feeling like i've somehow done something wrong.\
but maybe i have after all.

i wish we had more time\
to do all of the things that we want to do.\
i wish we had more friends\
to feel safe around, just like you.\
i wish we had more strength\
to take on everything that the world throws in our way.\
but maybe i'm meant to take the fall.

i don't know if i can convince myself\
that i'm doing the right thing every day.\
i don't know if i can trick myself\
into finding willpower and making it stay.\
i don't know if i can allow myself\
to be who i want and to walk my own path.\
but maybe i already do.

maybe it's okay to do no more than my best,\
no matter how high that best may be.\
maybe it's okay to do things that are different,\
no matter how many or few people will see.\
maybe it's okay to be myself,\
no matter how wrong they say i am.\
and maybe someday i'll look in the mirror and say, despite everything, it's still you.
