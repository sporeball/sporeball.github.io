title: chatter.

there's one appearance we made,\
reading prose on a Thursday night\
in spot number one,\
that we found more difficult\
than we expected to.

when you're in that spot,\
reading off your phone,\
you set the tone,\
even as they chatter to themselves -\
as they forget you.

we read our prose, just as we planned,\
but with zero makeup and an unsteady hand.

on that stage, we got vulnerable.\
we were out of place.

but we never come here with the intent to save face.

because the worst kind of chatter\
is the kind\
that pops up within yourself,\
instant dopamine cancel -\
detrimental to mental health.\
the kind that tells you "you shouldn't be here,"\
in a voice nobody else in the room can hear.\
the kind that tells you "their piece was better than yours",\
in a place where nobody is judged or scored.

fuck that noise.\
we're on this stage tonight\
and we're not going home without a fight.\
right?\
*right?*\
right.
