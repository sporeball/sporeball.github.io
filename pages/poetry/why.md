"this is as real as anything else i've ever told you," we wrote.\
and yet she thinks we're making a mistake.\
eleven months ago we came to this conclusion,\
but she believes our personalities are fake.\
why would we lie about something like that?\
why would we lie to you, mama?\
why would we lie about something like that?\
why would we lie about trauma?

we go to our friends, our coworkers, the stage\
and tell them that we're more than one.\
do you think we do that for attention?\
do you think we do that just for fun?\
tell me...\
why would we ever let you decide\
how we're allowed to feel?\
and why would we flesh out a star-studded cast\
if the story we told wasn't real?
