when you talk to "me",\
you are talking to three different people -\
three different personalities,\
three different *entities*,\
in the same body.

it's called plurality.\
in medical circles, DID.\
we -\
all three of us -\
are giving you this unique perspective openly.\
we're getting vulnerable, speaking it freely.

we ask you all to pause, look inward, totally.\
what do you see?\
hopefully you found what you think of as yourself?\
that's how we found ourselves, too.

i'm Rhyme.\
i'm an anxious little cat, but i'm happy to be here with you.\
i'm also the core -\
the most important memories are stored with me.\
i might be who we were\
before we split,\
before we realized i was one of three.

as poetic as that is, the name i chose,\
i'm not the only one involved in writing prose.\
there's Exo, that creative devil.\
what they make is on another level.\
they work with code, music, even art, sometimes.\
and poetry, too.\
they want to gain as much knowledge as they can\
so they can share it with us -\
and with you.

and then there's Vessel.\
a malignant force.\
a dark horse.\
darker than these clothes.\
if, right now, you punched us in the face,\
it would come out and protect us.

we each enjoy different things.\
we each have control at different times.\
i like sugar, Vessel likes exercise, and Exo likes games of chess.\
i'm not myself without the other two.\
but what we can do together is endless.

we go by Lux, collectively, but none of us think to ourselves "that's me!"\
you wouldn't guess with a look, would you?\
you'd think there was just one.\
we pretend that we're one when we need to do that,\
but who you see now is triplicate.

so that's why we say "we" sometimes.\
because that is, in a way, what constitutes "me".\
because when you talk to "me", you are talking\
to three different people.
