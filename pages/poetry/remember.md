we have issues with memory.\
maybe it's because of the switching between our personalities.\
maybe it's because of things that happened in our past.\
either way, it can be hard to keep track of what we did.\
what happens to us simply doesn't last.

entire days just disappear, you know.\
we couldn't tell you what we did a week, a month, or a year ago\
unless we took some extra time to think about it.\
and then when we figure it out, we feel disconnected from whatever it is.\
that is some scary shit.

we know *where* we are, but it doesn't seem real.\
we think back to times of burnout, or open mic turnout,\
to days spent with best friends, classes we've attended,\
misunderstandings, work shifts so demanding,\
or the places that we like to go.\
it all blends together.\
consistency? never,\
and we can't guess which one of us might have been in control.

should we take some more pictures? write more things down?\
or just make more good memories?\
we can think of some of those.\
that's it!\
for everything bad, there's something good\
that could be the subject of pages of prose.

people with lives as complex as our own.\
all the great things we've done. all the ways that we've grown.\
the taste of candy.\
a hug from your friends.\
all the things you can do before the day ends.\
because this world is absolutely beautiful.\
impossibly so.\
so although there's some stuff in your head for a time that might not stick around,\
there are so many things that are memorable.\
let them not be lost, but found.
