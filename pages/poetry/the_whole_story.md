to our mother:\
you may have thought that you know how to handle situations,\
but you don't know the whole story.\
you don't know that it's Rhyme who you fought with,\
who continues to wonder if she'll ever be understood.\
our therapist hears from her every week,\
and they know that her pain, avoidance and regression\
was caused by what you've done over the years.

to our professor:\
you may have told us to stop programming during your lecture,\
but you don't know the whole story.\
you don't know that it's Exo who you spoke to,\
who just wants to prove that they're good at what they do.\
some of our best works were made with their help,\
and they know that what they've accomplished\
is worth so much more than some college class.

to the thief:\
you may have stolen our skateboard from the light rail platform,\
but you don't know the whole story.\
you don't know that it's Vessel who you crossed,\
who would beat the shit out of you if it ever had the chance.\
our little sister put its board together,\
and she knows that a lot more than theft would have to happen\
before it would give up one of its favorite hobbies.

and to ourselves:\
we may think we know,\
but we never know the whole story.\
we still don't know a lot about Ghost,\
who appeared as our fourth when we thought we had three.\
Ghost is still learning about our part in this world,\
and Ghost knows that as long as that takes,\
we'll be right there to offer any support necessary.

because we need it.\
everybody needs it.\
be kind.\
you don't know the whole story.
