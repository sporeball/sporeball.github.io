we may not know the model, but it doesn't seem like anybody wants to find it.

in 2021, when i was a teenager on the Hack Club Slack, it seemed like we were all building projects for their own sake. there weren't as many of us building back then, but our motivation was intrinsic; the model as we know it today had not yet been discovered.\
now, it's as if Hack Club has moved house: from humble beginnings, it now rests on a completely different foundation, one of projects that were built in specific problem spaces to earn the author an extrinsic prize worth $5 an hour.

so many programs litter the Hack Club Slack that i now have trouble keeping track of which ones are masterminded solely by staff; which ones are community proposals that we liked enough to make a reality; and which ones are community proposals that will never see the light of day.\
even in a world with very little overlap in those who ship a project month to month, it feels difficult to choose, difficult to breathe.

as program authors, we assume that this is the way things ought to be, forgetting so easily that this is not the way that things have always been, nor is it the way that things should stay forever.\
through mindless repetition, we are now suffering **death by a thousand cuts**.

when a staff member who's been here for two months decides to run their third program built on the maxim of "build X to get Y", or a staff member who's been here for one day asks "what's the most common thing to send as a prize?", i kind of want to scream a little.\
don't get me wrong, i'm guilty of using that maxim too &ndash; but that's only because nobody acted, in a way i would notice, like it wasn't okay to do so.\
the people who have set the goals we have been asked to reach *know* that we won't reach them if we don't change. they've said so themselves &ndash; only, they keep on saying it like it's an aside.

instead of a simple "build and grow your programs while i'm gone", why aren't staff also told explicitly to play with the model as they do?

recently i was told that it's possible to run a program with **no** prize &ndash; asked to imagine a world where the budget of $5 an hour went towards the world's most interesting announcement, rather than any extrinsically motivating object &ndash; and i was completely floored.\
it makes sense why: if every author is allowed to do things the same way as every other, then anything different will start to come as a shock.\
but is the occasional shock really so bad?

if every single person who works here has to be a program author, why on earth should all the programs authored be shaped the same?

i want to run programs which ask you to make a friend, go outside, or bring back old projects from the dead.\
i want to see if passion projects like [Khel](https://github.com/sporeball/Khel){:target="_blank"} have their place here.\
i want to find out what happens if we do things differently.

i see gaps in the model that i'm not convinced aren't in others' blind spots.\
if that's true &ndash; if nobody else has the perspective that i have &ndash; then i need to use that perspective to do something that nobody has ever seen before.

**THE MODEL WILL FLIP ON ITS HEAD BY MY HAND.**

care to flip it alongside me?
